	CAPSLOCK  Terminator 2.0


Does this sound familiar: 
* You've never used the CAPS LOCK key on purpose, you've never needed it. 
* You've accidently pushed the key at least a thousand times. 
* YOU CONTINUE TYPING FOR ABOUT 10-30 SECONDS BEFORE YOU REALISE IT'S ON. 
* You have to retype the whole sentence (You don't have a convert-to-lowercase macro). 
* You have to hit the CAPSLOCK and SHIFT key about 5 times to figure out how to turn it off on this particular keyboard. 

For you, I've created waNOCAPS, the CAPSLOCK Terminator. 
It's not a program, it's a registry adjustment ('hack'). 
Inspiration came from: http://www.nthelp.com/50/remapctl.htm 
It has been tested on Win2000 and WinXP.

USAGE
-----
DISABLE YOUR CAPSLOCK: 
  * double-click disable_caps.reg 
  * reboot 
  * (Your CAPSLOCK actually becomes a 3rd CTRL-key) 
RE-ENABLE YOUR CAPSLOCK: 
  * double-click enable_caps.reg 
  * reboot
